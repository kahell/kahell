### Hi, Helfi here 🦸🏻‍♂️

I'm a Data Engineer from Jakarta, Indonesia, currently based in Singapore. My work revolves around data pipeline construction and web development. I take pride in transforming complex problems into simple, reliable, and customer-centric solutions.

🔭 I’m currently employed at Quadrant.io, a global leader in mobile location data, POI data, and corresponding compliance services. My role involves building and maintaining data technologies that support the company's operations. Why Quadrant.io? Here's a fun fact to explain 👇:

⚡ Fun fact: The field of mobile location and POI data is constantly evolving, with a wide range of innovations being explored. As a data engineer, I am tasked with ensuring that our data streams are efficient, reliable, and credible. This involves continually refining our algorithms and infrastructure to handle large volumes of data swiftly and accurately.

🤔 So that: The scope for growth in this field is immense. Beyond the immediate challenges of data streaming, there are numerous other aspects to consider, such as monitoring, logging, cost optimization, and setting up alerts for incidents or anomalies in the data.

I have learned and built several projects as an independent developer at [Helfi Pangestu Laboratory](https://github.com/Helfi-Pangestu-Labs). Some of the projects include:
- [Geohash Generator](https://pypi.org/project/geohash-generator) - A python module that provides function for converting geojson and shapefile to geohash.
